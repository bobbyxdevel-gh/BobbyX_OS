- **Future Consumers**: Run BobbyX_OS on everyday devices (PCs, tablets, or repurposed Android devices) for a unified, open-source computing experience.

## 4. Technical Architecture
### 4.1 Foundation: Linux From Scratch (LFS)
BobbyX_OS is built using the Linux From Scratch (LFS) framework, which allows for the creation of a custom Linux system tailored to the project’s goals. The core of BobbyX_OS is a custom-built Linux kernel, optimized for flexibility and compatibility. By starting with LFS, BobbyX_OS ensures complete control over the system’s components, avoiding unnecessary bloat and proprietary dependencies.

### 4.2 Kernel and Root Filesystem
- **Custom Linux Kernel**: The kernel is being developed using LFS, with a focus on supporting x86_64 architectures in the initial phase. Future iterations will target ARM and other architectures to enable universal compatibility.
- **Modular Root Filesystem**: To support diverse devices, BobbyX_OS will implement a modular rootfs design that can be customized based on the target hardware. This approach will streamline porting to devices like Chromebooks, Raspberry Pi, and Android devices.

### 4.3 Key Features (Planned)
- **WireGuard Connectivity Tool**: A standout feature of BobbyX_OS is a tool that enables secure, seamless connectivity between devices running the OS. Using WireGuard, a high-performance VPN protocol, this tool will allow users to create a private network for file sharing, remote access, or other collaborative tasks across their devices.
- **Privacy-First Design**: BobbyX_OS will exclude telemetry and invasive tracking mechanisms, ensuring that user data remains private. Additional security features, such as built-in encryption and sandboxing, are under consideration for future releases.
- **Customizable User Experience**: While the initial focus is on developers, BobbyX_OS will eventually offer a user-friendly interface and package manager to appeal to non-technical users.

### 4.4 Compatibility Strategy
The initial development of BobbyX_OS targets x86_64 architectures to establish a stable foundation. Compatibility with other devices (e.g., ARM-based Raspberry Pi, Chromebooks, and Android devices) will be achieved through:
- Researching and adapting to the bootloaders and firmware requirements of target devices.
- Designing a flexible rootfs that can be tailored to specific hardware architectures.
- Leveraging community expertise to address device-specific challenges.

## 5. Privacy and Security
BobbyX_OS is committed to providing a privacy-first operating system that stands in stark contrast to proprietary alternatives. Key privacy and security principles include:
- **No Telemetry**: BobbyX_OS will not collect or transmit user data, ensuring complete transparency.
- **Open-Source Codebase**: All components of BobbyX_OS will be open source, allowing users and developers to audit the code for security and privacy compliance.
- **Future Security Features**: Plans include implementing robust security measures such as disk encryption, secure boot, and application sandboxing to protect users from threats.

These commitments will be communicated through transparent documentation, community engagement, and regular updates on the project’s GitHub repository.

## 6. Open-Source Licensing and Community Collaboration
